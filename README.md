## Front End:

<hr>

## Back End:  
### Node.js, Express.js  

<hr>

## NPM packages:  
#### Express.js (npm i express)  
#### Body-Parser (npm i body-parser)

## Inspiration for building:  
#### I have always wanted to build a full stack application all by myself where I could test myself on my front-end and back-end skills and this is my first full-stack application.

## Challenges I ran into:
#### After connecting to my backend, my styles were not getting rendered, just the html content was being displayed. 
#### The form validation was giving an error for valid email-addresses and passwords too.
